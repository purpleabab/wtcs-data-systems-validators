# WTCS Data System Validators
### ADR 1: Deployment of web service on JBoss


#### Context
This application deploys to a web service.  There are mulitple implementations of javax.ws.rs, including Jersey and JBoss.  The Madison College Enterprise Java class taught the use of Jersey.  The WTCS current technology stack uses GlassFish 3.  Due to a security audit at WTCS, it is likely that WTCS will move from GlassFish to JBoss in the future, therefore it is advantageous for staff to gain experience with JBoss.

#### Decision
We will deploy our application on JBoss server 3.0.19, as included in the pom.xml
<!-- JBoss RESTeasy JAX-RS Implementation, Initializer, and Form Data Handler -->
<!-- Replaces Jersey as an implementation of the javax.ws.rs.* stuff -->

#### Status
Accepted

#### Consequences
Less technical teammates and classmates may be confused or overwhelmed by the addition of yet another new and different technology.
