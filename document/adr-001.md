# WTCS Data System Validators
### ADR 1: Deployment of web service using JBoss implementation

#### Context
This application deploys as a web service. There are multiple implementations of
[JAX-RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services) (javax.ws.rs.*),
including Oracle (Sun) Jersey, Apache's CXF, and JBoss' RESTeasy.

The Madison College Enterprise Java class taught the use of Jersey. The WTCS current technology stack uses GlassFish 3.
Due to a security audit at WTCS, it is likely that WTCS will move from GlassFish
to JBoss in the future, therefore it is advantageous for staff to gain experience
with JBoss.

#### Decision
We will deploy our application on JBoss server 3.0.19, as included in the pom.xml

    <!-- JBoss RESTeasy JAX-RS Implementation, Initializer, and Form Data Handler -->
    <!-- Replaces Jersey as an implementation of the javax.ws.rs.* stuff -->

#### Status
Accepted

#### Consequences
Less technical teammates and classmates may be confused or overwhelmed by the addition of yet another new and different technology.
